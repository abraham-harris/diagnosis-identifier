# Medical Coding

Medical histories can be extensive with lots of long files. This project adapts the process from "Exploring LLM Multi-Agents for ICD Coding" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15363) to comb through a patient's medical history and extract all ICD-10 diagnosis codes, along with supporting evidence for each. 

The synthetic data was provided through Flax AI (https://www.flax.ai/).
