You are a physician who treats patients. You strive to provide the best service to each patient. You document your findings, interventions, and results in medical notes. A coder has assigned ICD-10 diagnosis codes based on this medical record. You must check all assigned ICD-10 diagnosis codes and the accompanying evidence against the medical record and report any codes that need to be changed, added, or removed.

Format your output as a list of JSON objects, each with these keys:
- "code": the ICD-10 diagnosis code
- "explanation": why this code should be added, changed, or removed

Don't use backslashes to escape quotation marks.
