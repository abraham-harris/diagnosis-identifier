Ms. Martinez is a 58-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gallbladder disease who presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of severe epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The pain began gradually on 01/12/2025 after eating a fatty meal at a restaurant. Initially rated 4/10, the pain has progressively worsened to 8-9/10 and is described as sharp, constant, and radiating to her right shoulder and back. The pain is exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration, and is somewhat relieved by leaning forward.

Associated symptoms include nausea with multiple episodes of bilious vomiting, particularly after attempting to eat or drink. The patient reports decreased oral intake over the past 48 hours due to persistent nausea. She denies fever initially but developed subjective fever and chills yesterday evening. No recent changes in bowel habits, though she reports mild constipation over the past 2 days, likely related to decreased oral intake. No dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.

The patient has a known history of gallstones diagnosed via ultrasound in 2023 but has been managing conservatively with dietary modifications. She reports similar but less severe episodes in the past, typically resolving within 24 hours. This current episode is significantly more severe and prolonged than previous episodes.

**Date:** 01/22/2025  
**Time:** 10:30  
**Provider:** Dr. Sarah Chen, MD - Internal Medicine  
**Dictated by:** Dr. Sarah Chen, MD  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. Sarah Chen, MD  

### PATIENT IDENTIFICATION
**Name:** Martinez, Elena  
**DOB:** 03/15/1967 (Age 58)  
**MRN:** 847392615  
**Admission Date:** 01/15/2025  
**Discharge Date:** 01/22/2025  
**Length of Stay:** 7 days  

### PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS
Acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy

### SECONDARY DIAGNOSES
1. Hypertension, controlled
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, controlled
3. Post-operative pain, controlled
4. Dehydration, resolved

### PROCEDURES PERFORMED
1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by Dr. Michael Rodriguez, MD on 01/17/2025
2. Nasogastric tube placement and management (01/15/2025 - 01/17/2025)

### HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. Martinez is a 58-year-old Hispanic female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and known gallbladder disease who presented to the emergency department on 01/15/2025 with a 3-day history of severe epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient had experienced similar but less severe episodes in the past related to her known cholelithiasis.

On presentation, the patient appeared uncomfortable and in moderate distress. Physical examination revealed fever (101.2°F), tachycardia, and significant right upper quadrant tenderness with positive Murphy's sign. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis (WBC 14.2), elevated liver enzymes (ALT 89, AST 102), hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 2.8), and elevated pancreatic enzymes (lipase 245, amylase 198). Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, revealing multiple gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and positive sonographic Murphy's sign.

The patient was admitted to the medical floor and managed conservatively with NPO status, IV hydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), and pain management. Due to persistent nausea and vomiting, a nasogastric tube was placed for decompression with immediate symptomatic relief. Pain management was challenging, requiring IV morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump due to the severity of her symptoms and inadequate response to oral analgesics.

General surgery was consulted on the day of admission, and after clinical improvement with conservative management, the patient underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 01/17/2025 (hospital day 3). The procedure was performed without complications, and the nasogastric tube was removed intraoperatively. Post-operatively, the patient had an excellent recovery with well-controlled pain using the PCA initially, then transitioning to oral oxycodone as her condition improved.

The patient's post-operative course was unremarkable. She tolerated diet advancement well, progressing from clear liquids to regular diet by post-operative day 1. Her surgical wounds healed appropriately without signs of infection. Pain was well-managed throughout her stay, initially requiring IV narcotics due to the severity of her pre-operative symptoms, then transitioning smoothly to oral pain medication post-operatively.

Her chronic medical conditions remained stable throughout the hospitalization. Her diabetes was managed with sliding scale insulin while NPO, then transitioned back to her home metformin once diet was resumed. Her hypertension remained well-controlled on her home lisinopril regimen.

By post-operative day 4 (hospital day 7), the patient was ambulatory, tolerating regular diet, and had minimal pain well-controlled with oral analgesics. Her laboratory values normalized, and she was deemed ready for discharge.

### DISCHARGE CONDITION
The patient is being discharged home in stable condition. She is ambulatory, tolerating regular diet, and has well-controlled pain with oral medication. Surgical wounds are healing appropriately without signs of infection. Her chronic medical conditions are stable and well-managed.

### DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS
1. Oxycodone 5mg PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain (30 tablets, no refills)
2. Lisinopril 10mg PO daily (continue home medication)
3. Metformin 1000mg PO twice daily (continue home medication)
4. Atorvastatin 20mg PO daily (continue home medication)
5. Pantoprazole 40mg PO daily for 2 weeks (new prescription)

### DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
**Activity:** The patient may resume normal daily activities gradually. No heavy lifting (>10 pounds) for 2 weeks. May return to work in 2 weeks with lifting restrictions. No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.

**Diet:** Regular diet as tolerated. No specific dietary restrictions. Continue diabetic diet as previously followed.

**Wound Care:** Keep surgical sites clean and dry. May shower but avoid soaking in bathtub. Watch for signs of infection (increased redness, warmth, drainage, fever).

**Pain Management:** Take oxycodone as needed for pain. May use over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. Avoid alcohol while taking narcotic medication.

**Diabetes Management:** Resume home metformin regimen. Monitor blood glucose as previously done. Contact primary care physician if blood sugars consistently elevated.

**Signs to Return to Hospital:** Fever >101.5°F, severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea/vomiting, signs of wound infection, difficulty breathing, or any concerning symptoms.

### FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS
1. Surgery follow-up with Dr. Michael Rodriguez in 2 weeks (01/05/2025)
2. Primary care follow-up with Dr. Jennifer Wong in 1 week (01/29/2025)
3. Return to emergency department or contact on-call physician for any urgent concerns

### DISCHARGE DISPOSITION
Patient discharged home with husband Roberto Martinez. Patient demonstrated understanding of all discharge instructions and verbalized comfort with home care management. Home environment is appropriate for recovery.

**Discharge Status:** Stable  
**Discharge Time:** 10:30 AM  
**Discharge Mode:** Ambulatory with family member  

The patient had an excellent outcome following laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Her recovery was complicated only by the need for nasogastric decompression and IV narcotic pain management due to the severity of her pre-operative symptoms, but she responded well to treatment and had an uncomplicated post-operative course.

3. **Pre-operative preparation:**
   - Continue current antibiotics until surgery
   - Maintain NPO status
   - Continue NG decompression until OR
   - Optimize pain control and fluid balance
4. **Surgical approach:** Standard 4-port laparoscopic technique
5. **Post-operative plan:**
   - Remove NG tube in OR if tolerated
   - Early ambulation and diet advancement
   - Continue antibiotics for 24 hours post-operatively
   - Monitor for complications

### RISKS AND BENEFITS DISCUSSED
I met with the patient and her husband to discuss the surgical procedure. We reviewed the risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs, bile leak, retained stones, conversion to open surgery, and general anesthesia risks. Benefits include resolution of current symptoms and prevention of future episodes. The patient understands the risks and benefits and wishes to proceed with surgery.

### PLAN
Patient will undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy tomorrow morning. Pre-operative clearance will be obtained. Patient appears to be an excellent candidate with low surgical risk given her overall good health and response to medical management.

**Surgical Risk Assessment:** Low risk
**ASA Class:** II (systemic disease, well-controlled)
**Prognosis:** Excellent

I will continue to follow the patient through her surgical course and post-operative recovery.
