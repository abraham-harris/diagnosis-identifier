NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE

PATIENT: VANCE, ELEANOR
DOB: 07/16/1945
DATE OF CONSULT: 08/20/2024
REFERRING MD: Dr. Emily Carter
REASON FOR CONSULT: R hand tremor, bradykinesia. ?Parkinson's disease.

HPI:
Ms. Vance is a pleasant 78 y/o R-handed female presenting for evaluation of progressive neurological symptoms. Onset approx 4-6 months ago w/ R hand tremor, initially intermittent, now more persistent, esp. at rest ("pill-rolling" quality). Reports associated slowness of movement (bradykinesia), difficulty w/ fine motor tasks (buttoning, handwriting - "smaller, more cramped"). Gait feels "shaky," some postural instability, no definite falls until recently (one minor in garden). Denies diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sensory loss, weakness. Notes some mild axial stiffness.
Brain MRI (08/05/2024) showed age-related changes, no acute pathology.
PMH: HTN, Hypothyroidism, OA.
Meds: Lisinopril, Levothyroxine, Tylenol PRN, Vit D.
Social: Widowed, lives alone.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:
Mental Status: A&Ox3. Intact attention, language, memory (3/3 recall at 5 min). Mood appears euthymic today.
CN: II-XII intact. PERRLA, EOMI. Visual fields full to confrontation. Face symmetric.
Motor:
  Tone: Cogwheel rigidity R>L UE, mild R LE. Normal L UE.
  Strength: 5/5 throughout, though effort seems slow.
  Tremor: Visible R hand resting tremor (4-6 Hz, pill-rolling). Emerges with distraction. Minimal R leg tremor. No head tremor. No significant postural or action tremor.
  Coordination: Finger-to-nose shows mild dysmetria R, slow. Heel-to-shin intact. RAMs (finger taps, hand open/close, foot taps) markedly slow and reduced amplitude R>L (bradykinesia).
Sensation: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, proprioception throughout.
Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout. Plantars downgoing.
Gait/Station: Stands with slightly stooped posture. Initiation slow. Reduced R arm swing. Stride length shortened. Turns en bloc, requires multiple steps. Pull test: Retropulsion (2 steps to recover). Able to walk on toes/heels. Tandem difficult.
UPDRS Part III (Motor Exam): 28/108. Notable scores for tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural stability.

ASSESSMENT:
78 y/o female with progressive asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Clinical picture is highly consistent with **Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD)**.
Hoehn & Yahr Stage: 2.0 (bilateral symptoms, no impairment of balance on pull test if she takes 1 step, but she took 2, so arguably 2.5).

PLAN:
1.  Diagnosis of PD discussed extensively with patient. Provided educational materials.
2.  Initiate Levodopa therapy: Carbidopa/Levodopa 25/100mg, 1 tab PO TID. Start 1/2 tab TID x 1 wk, then increase to 1 tab TID if tolerated. Discussed potential side effects (nausea, dizziness, orthostasis).
3.  Referral to Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy (PT/OT) for evaluation and treatment. Specifically recommend LSVT BIG program for PT if available.
4.  Discussed importance of regular exercise, diet, hydration.
5.  Safety: Fall precautions reinforced. Home safety eval by OT.
6.  Follow-up: Return to clinic in 3 months for assessment of L-dopa response and any side effects.
7.  Encouraged to connect with local Parkinson's support groups.
