ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.  R Hand Tremor & Bradykinesia: Concerning for possible Parkinson's disease vs. Essential Tremor. Will refer to Neurology. Ordered Brain MRI to r/o structural pathology.
2.  Gait Instability / Fall Risk: Moderate risk. Advised on home safety, removing throw rugs, ensuring adequate lighting. PT eval discussed, deferred pending Neuro.
3.  HTN: Controlled. Continue Lisinopril.
4.  Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continue Levothyroxine.
