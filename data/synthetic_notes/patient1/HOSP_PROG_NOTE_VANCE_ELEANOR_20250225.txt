A/P:
79 y/o F POD #9 L Hip ORIF, complicated by post-op delirium (improving) and now new Aspiration Pneumonia. Parkinson's Disease.

1.  **Aspiration Pneumonia (RLL):**
    * Likely secondary to dysphagia (known from SLP eval) in setting of post-op state, delirium, PD.
    * Initiated Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h and Azithromycin 500mg IV q24h (empiric, will tailor to cultures).
    * Continue O2 via NC, titrate to keep SpO2 >92%.
    * Encourage IS, C&DB.
    * Strict aspiration precautions. Continue SLP recs (nectar-thick, pureed). Monitor oral intake. Consider NGT if intake poor or aspiration signs worsen, though pt resistant.
    * Pulmonology consulted for recs.

2.  **Post-Op Delirium:**
    * Improved from prior days but not fully resolved. Multifactorial (post-op, infection, unfamiliar env, PD).
    * Continue non-pharm interventions (reorientation, sleep hygiene, mobility as tolerated).
    * Avoid benzos, anticholinergics. Quetiapine 25mg PO HS PRN severe agitation (used once last night).
    * Geriatrics recs being followed.

3.  **L Hip Fracture s/p ORIF:**
    * Pain controlled with PO meds. Incision CDI.
    * Lovenox 40mg SC QD for DVT proph. SCDs on.
    * PT: TTWB LLE. Continue bedside therapy as tolerated. Progress slow due to medical issues.

4.  **Parkinson's Disease:**
    * Medications (C/L CR BID, Ropinirole TID) administered on strict schedule. Avoid interruptions.
    * Monitor for motor fluctuations, dyskinesias.
    * Neurology aware of current status.

5.  **Nutrition:**
    * Poor PO intake. Monitor closely. Dietitian consulted.
    * Continue modified diet per SLP.

6.  **Prophylaxis:** GI (Pantoprazole 40mg IV qd), DVT (Lovenox).

7.  **Other:** HTN, Hypothyroidism stable on home meds.

Plan:
- Monitor response to abx.
- Daily labs (CBC, CMP).
- Follow cultures.
- Aggressive PT/OT once medically stable.
- Continue focus on delirium prevention/management.
- Case Management actively involved for DC planning (SNF likely).
