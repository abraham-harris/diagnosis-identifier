SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY - BEDSIDE SWALLOW EVALUATION

PATIENT: VANCE, ELEANOR
MRN: 9876543
DOB: 07/16/1945
DATE OF EVAL: 02/26/2025
REFERRING MD: Dr. Chen (Hospitalist)
REASON FOR REFERRAL: Coughing with thin liquids, recent desaturation, suspected aspiration pneumonia. Hx of Parkinson's Disease.

BACKGROUND: Pt is a 79 y/o F s/p L hip ORIF on 02/16. Developed post-op delirium and subsequently RLL pneumonia (CT 02/25). PMH significant for PD. Currently on O2 via NC. Alertness fluctuates, today pt is drowsy but arousable, follows simple commands.

ORAL MOTOR ASSESSMENT:
Labial strength/ROM: WFL for seal.
Lingual strength/ROM: Reduced anterior-posterior movement, mild lingual tremor noted.
Jaw strength/ROM: WFL.
Velopharyngeal function: Voice slightly wet/gurgly pre-swallow.
Laryngeal palpation: Elevation appears mildly reduced during dry swallows.
Volitional cough: Weak, boggy.

SWALLOW TRIALS (PO trials with ice chips, then various consistencies as tolerated):
- Ice chips: Tolerated x3 small presentations. No overt s/sx aspiration.
- Thin liquids (water via teaspoon): Multiple episodes of coughing noted after ~3-5cc presentation. Wet vocal quality post-swallow. O2 sat dropped from 94% to 90% during thin liquid trials.
- Nectar-thick liquids (via teaspoon, cup): Delayed swallow initiation. No cough. Mild oral residue.
- Pureed solids (applesauce via spoon): Delayed swallow initiation. Reduced lingual transit. Some pocketing in R buccal cavity. No overt s/sx aspiration. Throat clear post-swallow.

IMPRESSION:
Moderate Oropharyngeal Dysphagia characterized by:
- Reduced lingual control and motility.
- Delayed swallow initiation across consistencies.
- Reduced laryngeal elevation (clinical sign).
- Overt signs of aspiration (coughing, O2 desat) with THIN LIQUIDS.
- Silent aspiration risk is HIGH with thin liquids given PD, wet vocal quality, and history of pneumonia.
- Tolerated nectar-thick liquids and pureed solids with minimal overt difficulty during eval but with some oral phase deficits noted. Potential for fatigue with meals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  DIET: NPO until formal instrumental assessment can be completed (VFSS preferred, FEES if pt cannot transport).
    * *Pending discussion with team re: urgency of VFSS vs. empiric trial:* If PO must be initiated prior to instrumental, recommend **Pureed Solids and Nectar-Thick Liquids.** Strict supervision during meals.
2.  STRATEGIES:
    * Small bites/sips.
    * Alternate bites/sips.
    * No straws.
    * Upright positioning (90 degrees) during and for 30-60 mins after all PO intake.
    * Good oral care pre/post meals.
3.  Re-assess swallow function daily at bedside.
4.  Recommend VFSS to further delineate swallow physiology and guide diet advancement.
5.  Educate patient (as able) and nursing staff on safe swallowing strategies and aspiration precautions.
