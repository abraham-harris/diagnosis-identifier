PROCEDURES:

2.  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest - 02/25/2025.
3.  Multiple X-rays (Hip, Chest).
4.  Bedside swallow evaluation by Speech Language Pathologist.
5.  Physical and Occupational Therapy evaluations and treatments.

CONSULTATIONS:
Orthopedics (Dr. Miller), Anesthesia, Hospitalist (Dr. Chen), Cardiology (Dr. Ramirez - pre-op), Geriatrics (Dr. Albright - delirium), Pulmonology (Dr. Singh - pneumonia, phone consult), Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Case Management/Social Work.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms. Eleanor Vance is a 79 y/o F with PMH of Parkinson's Disease, high blood pressure, and an underactive thyroid who presented to ED on 02/15/2025 after a fall at home resulting in a left upper thigh bone fracture near the hip.
-   **Orthopedic:** Underwent surgical repair of the left hip fracture on 02/16/2025 by Dr. Miller. Post-operative course managed by Orthopedic and Hospitalist services. Wound clean, dry, intact at discharge. Instructed for toe-touch weight bearing on the left leg.
-   **Delirium:** Developed acute confusion starting on the fourth day after surgery, characterized by disorientation and agitation. This was assessed as delirium. Managed with non-pharmacological interventions, environmental modifications, careful medication review (Amantadine held), and judicious use of low-dose Quetiapine. Geriatrics consulted. The delirium had largely resolved by discharge, though some mild residual disorientation was noted at times.
-   **Aspiration Pneumonia:** On the eighth day after surgery, developed fever, cough, and low oxygen levels. Chest X-ray and subsequent Chest CT confirmed lung inflammation in the right lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Sputum culture grew mixed oral flora. Treated with intravenous Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin (completed 7-day course of Ceftriaxone, 5 days Azithromycin). Clinically improved, afebrile, and oxygen saturation stable on room air at discharge.
-   **Dysphagia:** Speech Language Pathology evaluation revealed moderate difficulty with swallowing in the mouth and throat area, with a risk for aspiration of thin liquids. Placed on pureed solids and nectar-thick liquids. Tolerating this diet at discharge.
-   **Parkinson's Disease:** Home medications (Carbidopa/Levodopa CR, Sertraline, Levothyroxine, Lisinopril) continued. Amantadine held due to delirium. Ropinirole added by Neurology for motor symptoms during hospital stay. Medications timed carefully.
-   **Mobility/Function:** Received Physical and Occupational Therapy. At discharge, requires moderate assistance for transfers, minimal assistance for bed mobility, and minimal to moderate assistance for activities of daily living. Ambulates short distances with a rolling walker and standby assistance.
-   **Discharge Planning:** Extensive planning by Case Management/Social Work. Patient and son agree to Skilled Nursing Facility placement for continued rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Stable. Afebrile. Pain controlled on oral medications. Tolerating modified diet.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to **Willow Creek Rehab Center**.
