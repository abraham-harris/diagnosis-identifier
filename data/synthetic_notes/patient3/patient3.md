### H&P Note (1 of 1)

**Date of Admission:** 07/02/2025
**Time:** 18:30
**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Evelyn Reed, MD

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 2 days.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Mr. Michael Serrano is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain. He describes the pain as sharp, constant, and radiating to his right shoulder and back. The pain is currently an 8/10 in severity. He reports the pain began approximately 48 hours ago but became markedly worse after eating a fatty meal (a burger and fries) yesterday evening. Since then, the pain has been unremitting. He has associated nausea and has vomited twice today, with non-bloody, non-bilious emesis. He also reports subjective fevers and chills. He denies any significant diarrhea or constipation. He tried taking over-the-counter Tylenol, which provided minimal relief. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The escalating severity of the pain prompted him to seek emergency medical attention this afternoon.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
* **Hypertension:** Diagnosed approximately 10 years ago. He reports inconsistent medication adherence due to his living situation.
* **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Diagnosed 5 years ago. He checks his blood sugar "when he can" and takes oral medication, but again, reports inconsistent access and adherence. He does not use insulin.
* **Chronic Low Back Pain:** Attributed to degenerative disc disease, managed intermittently with over-the-counter analgesics.
* **Surgical History:** Right inguinal hernia repair, approximately 20 years ago.
* **Hospitalizations:** One previous admission for community-acquired pneumonia 3 years ago.

**MEDICATIONS (Reported Home Meds):**
* Lisinopril 20 mg daily (intermittent use)
* Metformin 500 mg twice daily (intermittent use)
* Acetaminophen 500 mg as needed for back pain

**ALLERGIES:**
* Codeine - Causes severe nausea and vomiting.

**SOCIAL HISTORY:**
Mr. Serrano is single and has no children. He has a history of skilled labor (construction) but has been unemployed for the past three years after a layoff. He is currently unhoused and has been staying at various city shelters for the past 18 months. He reports this makes managing his chronic conditions, including diet and medication, extremely difficult. He denies any smoking or illicit drug use. He reports drinking alcohol socially in the past but has had "maybe two beers in the last year." He is a high school graduate. He appears to have decisional capacity and is his own healthcare proxy. The lack of stable housing is a significant barrier to care and will require careful discharge planning. Social Work consult will be placed.

**ASSESSMENT & PLAN:**
Mr. Michael Serrano is a 58-year-old unhoused male with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents with clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings consistent with **Acute Calculous Cholecystitis**.

**Plan by Problem:**

1.  **Acute Cholecystitis / RUQ Pain:**
    * Admit to General Surgery service.
    * NPO status.
    * IV Fluids: Lactated Ringer's at 100 mL/hr.
    * Pain Management: Start with IV morphine 4mg q4h PRN for severe pain. We will monitor closely and aim to provide adequate analgesia.
    * Antibiotics: IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam 3.375 g IV q6h to cover for potential infection.
    * Labs: CBC and BMP in the AM.
    * Plan for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, likely within the next 24-48 hours. Will obtain surgical consent.

2.  **Hypertension:**
    * BP is elevated, likely exacerbated by pain and acute illness.
    * Restart home lisinopril 20 mg PO daily once tolerating PO.
    * Monitor BP closely with vital signs.

3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    * Hyperglycemia noted on admission.
    * Initiate subcutaneous insulin sliding scale coverage for blood glucose >180 mg/dL.
    * Check blood glucose every 6 hours.
    * Restart home metformin once afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and tolerating PO diet post-operatively.

4.  **Social Disposition / Homelessness:**
    * This is a critical component of the patient's care and a significant barrier to a safe discharge.
    * Consult Social Work and Case Management immediately to begin assessing needs and exploring post-discharge options, including shelter placement with medical respite capabilities if available.
    * Will need to ensure patient has a reliable way to obtain and store medications and attend follow-up appointments.

5.  **DVT Prophylaxis:**
    * Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q8h.

I have discussed the diagnosis, rationale for admission, and plan for surgery with the patient. He understands and agrees with the plan.

### Consult Note (1 of 1)

**Date of Consult:** 07/03/2025
**Time:** 10:15
**Consulting Service:** Anesthesiology
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. David Chen, MD
**Reason for Consult:** Pre-operative evaluation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
I was asked to evaluate Mr. Michael Serrano, a 58-year-old male, for pre-operative clearance for a planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The patient was admitted yesterday with a 2-day history of severe RUQ pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. An ultrasound confirmed gallstones and cholecystitis. He is currently NPO, receiving IV fluids and antibiotics (Piperacillin-Tazobactam). His pain has been difficult to control, requiring multiple doses of IV morphine since admission.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
* Hypertension: On lisinopril, reported inconsistent adherence.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: On metformin, inconsistent adherence. Admission glucose was 185 mg/dL, currently managed with sliding scale insulin.
* Chronic Low Back Pain.
* Allergies: Codeine (nausea/vomiting).

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (Anesthesia Focused):**
* **Airway:** No history of difficult intubation, no loose teeth, dentures, or hoarseness. Mallampati score is Class II. Thyromental distance is adequate (>6 cm). Good neck range of motion.
* **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, orthopnea, or PND. He can walk several blocks on flat ground before stopping, but this is limited by back pain, not dyspnea (METS > 4). BP on admission was 158/92, currently 145/88. EKG reviewed (see below).
* **Pulmonary:** Non-smoker. No history of asthma, COPD, or sleep apnea. Lungs are clear.
* **Neurological:** A&O x4. No history of stroke or TIA.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Currently NPO since midnight. At risk for aspiration given acute abdomen and opioid use.
* **Endocrine:** T2DM, managed with metformin at home. Will need intra-operative and post-operative glucose monitoring.
* **Musculoskeletal:** Chronic low back pain. Will require careful positioning on the OR table.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
* **Vitals:** T 37.8°C, HR 95, BP 145/88, RR 18, SpO2 97% on RA.
* **General:** Alert and cooperative male in mild discomfort.
* **Airway:** Mallampati II, adequate mouth opening, full neck ROM.
* **Heart:** Regular rhythm, no murmurs.
* **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation.

**DIAGNOSTICS REVIEW:**
* **EKG (07/02/2025):** Normal sinus rhythm at 98 bpm. No acute ST changes or signs of ischemia. Normal intervals. Left ventricular hypertrophy criteria are met.
* **Labs (07/02/2025):** WBC 15.2 (resolving to 13.5 this AM), Hgb 14.5, Plt 220. BUN/Cr 20/1.1 (stable). LFTs mildly elevated as expected with cholecystitis.

**ANESTHESIA ASSESSMENT:**
This is a 58-year-old male with acute cholecystitis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes presenting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System, I would classify this patient as **ASA Class 3E**.
* Class 3: Severe systemic disease (HTN, T2DM).
* Modifier E: Emergency surgery.

**ANESTHESIA PLAN:**
1.  **Anesthetic Plan:** General endotracheal anesthesia (GETA). Given the acute abdomen and opioid use, he is considered a full stomach, and a rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is planned to secure the airway and minimize aspiration risk.
2.  **Monitoring:** Standard ASA monitors including EKG, NIBP, SpO2, and end-tidal CO2. An arterial line is not deemed necessary at this time but will be available if hemodynamic instability occurs.
3.  **Induction:** Propofol and succinylcholine (or rocuronium if any contraindication arises) for RSI.
4.  **Maintenance:** Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane or desflurane and rocuronium for muscle relaxation.
5.  **Pain Management:** Multimodal approach. Pre-operative Acetaminophen 1000 mg IV. Intra-operatively, will administer fentanyl. Will discuss regional options (e.g., transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block) with the surgical team, which could significantly aid post-operative pain control. Post-operatively, will recommend a Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump with Dilaudid (hydromorphone) given his significant pre-op pain and need for IV narcotics.
6.  **Fluid Management:** Goal-directed fluid therapy with crystalloids.
7.  **Glycemic Control:** Will monitor point-of-care glucose at least once intraoperatively and manage with IV insulin as needed per protocol.
8.  **Post-operative Nausea/Vomiting (PONV) Prophylaxis:** He has one risk factor (opioids). Will provide prophylaxis with dexamethasone (after induction) and ondansetron (at end of case).

I have discussed the anesthetic plan, including the risks (sore throat, dental injury, aspiration, medication reaction) and benefits, with the patient. He verbalized understanding and consented to the plan. He is cleared for surgery from an anesthesia standpoint.

**ASA Class:** 3E
**Pre-Op Vitals:** HR 95, BP 145/88, SpO2 97%
**Allergies:** Codeine (N/V)

**Anesthetic Plan & Course:**
Patient was brought to the operating room and standard ASA monitors were applied. A 18g IV was confirmed patent. Pre-oxygenation was performed. Given the patient's acute abdomen, a rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was performed. Anesthesia was induced with 200 mg of Propofol and 100 mg of Succinylcholine. A cuffed 8.0 endotracheal tube was inserted on the first attempt with direct laryngoscopy, with good bilateral breath sounds and end-tidal CO2 confirmation. Tube secured at 23 cm at the lip.

Anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane (1.5-2.0 MAC) in an Oxygen/Air mixture. Muscle relaxation was maintained with Rocuronium 50mg after succinylcholine wore off, with subsequent redosing based on train-of-four monitoring. Patient received 4mg of Dexamethasone for PONV prophylaxis after induction. He also received 1000mg of IV Acetaminophen for multimodal analgesia.

Hemodynamics remained stable throughout the procedure. Blood pressure ranged from 110/60 to 135/80, and heart rate from 70-90 bpm. A pneumoperitoneum was established for laparoscopy, which was well tolerated hemodynamically. Minimal blood loss.

Intraoperative fluids consisted of 1200 mL of Lactated Ringer's. Urine output was 200 mL. A point-of-care glucose was 155 mg/dL; no insulin was required.

Towards the end of the procedure, the patient received 100 mcg of Fentanyl for anticipated post-operative pain. At the conclusion of the surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed with 200 mg of Sugammadex. The patient resumed spontaneous respirations and was extubated once awake and following commands. He was then transported to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) in stable condition.

**PACU Course:**
Patient arrived in PACU awake and alert, though drowsy. Initial pain score was 9/10. He received a total of 2mg of IV hydromorphone in PACU in divided doses, with slight improvement in pain to 7/10. Vital signs remained stable. He was deemed stable for transfer to the surgical floor with a hydromorphone PCA pump initiated.

### Discharge Summary (1 of 1)

**Date of Admission:** 07/02/2025
**Date of Discharge:** 07/08/2025
**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Evelyn Reed, MD
**Discharge Physician:** Dr. Evelyn Reed, MD

**PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:**
Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

**OTHER DIAGNOSES:**
* Hypertension
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
* Homelessness
* Post-operative Pain

**PROCEDURES PERFORMED:**
* Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy on 07/03/2025

**ALLERGIES:**
* Codeine (Nausea/Vomiting)

**HOSPITAL COURSE:**
Mr. Michael Serrano is a 58-year-old male with a history of HTN and T2DM who was admitted on 07/02/2025 for acute cholecystitis. He presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of severe, constant right upper quadrant pain, fevers, and nausea. His physical exam was notable for a positive Murphy's sign. Laboratory workup revealed a leukocytosis of 15.2 K/uL and elevated transaminases. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis, showing a thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid, and multiple gallstones.

The patient was admitted to the general surgery service, made NPO, and started on IV fluids and IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam. His pain was severe upon admission and was initially managed with intermittent IV morphine with limited success. Anesthesia was consulted and cleared him for surgery.

On hospital day 2 (07/03/2025), the patient underwent a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure was uncomplicated. Intra-operatively, an inflamed, edematous gallbladder with multiple cholesterol stones was found and removed.

The immediate post-operative course was complicated by **significant, uncontrolled pain**. The patient required high doses of IV hydromorphone and was placed on a Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump. On post-operative day 0, his pain management was challenging, requiring adjustments to his PCA settings to include a basal rate plus patient-controlled doses, supplemented with scheduled IV acetaminophen.

Over post-operative days 1 through 3, his pain gradually improved. He was advanced from NPO to a clear liquid and then to a low-fat solid diet, all of which he tolerated well. He worked with physical therapy and progressed from ambulating with assistance to ambulating independently in the hallways. His pain was successfully transitioned from the IV PCA to an oral regimen of hydromorphone and acetaminophen. His leukocytosis resolved, and his LFTs trended down appropriately. His home medications for hypertension (Lisinopril) and diabetes (Metformin) were restarted, and his blood pressures and glucose levels were well-controlled prior to discharge.

A critical aspect of this patient's hospitalization was his social situation. He is **unhoused**, which presented a significant barrier to a safe discharge. The Case Management and Social Work teams were involved from the day of admission. They worked diligently with the patient to identify a suitable disposition. A plan was formulated for discharge to a local medical respite shelter, which can accommodate his post-operative recovery needs, ensure medication adherence, and provide a clean, safe environment. A bed at this facility was secured on hospital day 6, allowing for discharge on hospital day 7.

**DISCHARGE CONDITION:**
On the day of discharge, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His pain was well-controlled on oral analgesics. His abdominal incisions were clean, dry, and intact. He was ambulating without difficulty and tolerating a low-fat diet. He was deemed medically stable for discharge.

**DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:**
Discharged to **Community Medical Respite Shelter**. Transportation arranged by case management.

**DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:**
* **Hydromorphone 2 mg:** 1 tablet by mouth every 4 hours as needed for severe pain. (Dispense #30)
* **Acetaminophen 650 mg:** 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for mild pain. (OTC)
* **Lisinopril 20 mg:** 1 tablet by mouth once daily. (Dispense #30)
* **Metformin 500 mg:** 1 tablet by mouth twice daily with meals. (Dispense #60)
* **Docusate Sodium 100 mg:** 1 capsule by mouth twice daily while taking opioid pain medication. (OTC)

**DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
* **Diet:** Continue a low-fat diet for the next 2 weeks. Avoid greasy, fried, or fatty foods.
* **Activity:** No heavy lifting (>10 lbs) for 4-6 weeks. Continue to walk daily. May shower, but do not soak incisions in a bath or pool.
* **Incision Care:** Keep Steri-strips in place. They will fall off on their own in 7-14 days. Monitor for signs of infection, including increasing redness, swelling, purulent drainage, or fever >101°F (38.3°C), and call the clinic or return to the ED if these occur.
* **Follow-up:** The patient is scheduled for a post-operative follow-up appointment with Dr. Evelyn Reed in the General Surgery Clinic on **July 16, 2025, at 14:00**. The patient was given an appointment slip and contact information. The case manager at the shelter will assist him with transportation.
